Started coding the whole project : the CMakelists shouldn't be more of a problem in the future. The main program is for now one the of the TP, it will be adjusted after the different classes are created. Two of them are in construction : the Visualiser one and the GN_Astrobject. The Visualizer class will overall contain static functions for initialization and automatic buffer gestion etc. and the GN_Astrobject will represent a planet, a sun or a moon. I need to implement inheritance with new subclasses (one for each type) for next time.

Abandoned the idea of using inheritance because the Sun will be the only "different" object, it will just needs to have some attributes sets to 0 to work. The main file is starting working with the visualizer, but it's just the beginning of big upcoming changes.

Happy new year ! (I wish could've started this project sooner). Anyway, the GN_Astrobjects are finally initialized and they will soon be able to be used for rendering. I just need to deal with textures for next time. The visualizer class may need some cleanup but that's only minor priority.

What a productive day today ! Finally fixed texture stuff and the Astrobjects are done for the basic part (sphere display, texture, movement). Build a minimal and approximative solar system, that needs to be adjusted with ellipses.

Didn't even take time to write here those past days. Started working with Lori (we both needed it) and the productivity was boosted. Here, we have a full set of planets with their satellites, including planets with rings. Each of their orbit is correct according to aphelion/perihelion/excentricity, even though their might still be some unhandled stuff with the orbital inclination.

Today we added all the moons required. We also work on the trajectories of the Astrobjects. Staturn and Uranus have rings ! We added a debugMode to see all planets and moons line up
